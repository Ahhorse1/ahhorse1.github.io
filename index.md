## Myself as a Person
Born and raised in **Columbus, Ohio**

I'm currently a second-year CS Major with a Business Minor

~~When I'm not questioning why I chose to be a CS Major~~, I'm usually playing tennis, surfing, playing Pokemon Go, or in the gym
Random Quote from Dublin Airport in Ireland I found entertaining
> Saying I ran a half marathon is better than saying I tried running a marathon and quit halfway

I'm also an aviation enthusiast and enjoy plane spotting commerical aircraft from time to time

Some of my favorite aircraft include
- B747-400, the Iconic Queen of the Skies
- B787-800, it's hard to beat wing flex
- A320-200, an absolute workhorse, the winglets are *chef's kiss* 
## Myself as a Programmer
My first CS Class was AP Computer Science A in 2018 where I learned Java

Since then I've taken at least one CS class every year.
