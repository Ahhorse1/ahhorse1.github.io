## Myself as a Person
Born and raised in **Columbus, Ohio**. However, I did spend one year of preschool, one year of elementary, and middle school in France.

This is a photo of Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in western Europe, that I took with my phone through binoculars during sunset this summer.

I'm currently a second-year CS Major with a Business Minor

~~When I'm not questioning why I chose to be a CS Major~~, I'm usually playing tennis, surfing, cooking, or playing Pokemon Go

My top three favorite Pokemon
1. Ivysaur ![Ivysaur](assets/IvysaurResized.jpg)
2. Steelix ![Steelix](assets/SteelixResized.png)
3. Rayquaza ![Rayquaza](assets/RayquazaResized.png)

Random Quote from Dublin Airport in Ireland I found entertaining this summer
> Saying I ran a half marathon is better than saying I tried running a marathon and quit halfway

I'm also an aviation enthusiast and enjoy plane spotting commerical aircraft from time to time

:airplane: [Flight Tracking Website](flightradar24.com)

Some of my favorite aircraft include
- B747-400, the Iconic Queen of the Skies
- B787-800, it's hard to beat wing flex
- A320-200, an absolute workhorse, the winglets are *chef's kiss* 

Things I would like to accomplish

- [x] Finish This Lab
- [ ] Start Pilot's License
- [ ] Achieve Level 50 In Pokemon Go

## Myself as a Programmer
My first CS Class was AP Computer Science A in 2018 where I learned Java

Since then I've taken at least one CS class every year.

I enjoy participating in hack-a-thons, capture the flags, or just coding for fun.
My friends and I would also compete under this name in any coding competition.
